# My Web Gadgets

This is a collection of small projects, mostly in JavaScript. This repo also includes some test projects in languages I'm learning, like "Brainfrick" that is written in Go.

Pages that use assets like audio and images may be blocked by your browsers CORS cross-origin policies. To circumvent this, spin up a simple web server like `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000` or `python3 -m http.server`.


### Please note, many of these are Work In Progress, some are unfinished, and many were made when i was 15-16 years old. No quality guaranteed :)

I try to keep folder/file/variable names self explanatory, and to keep the code commented.
Some of these project details are in norwegian, but all code, comments and variable names will always be in english.
